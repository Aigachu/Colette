# colettebot (No longer maintained)
Colettebot is a personal bot made by branching off of hydrabolt's beautiful discord connection script, [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/).

### Set up
The easiest setup would be to clone the discord.js repo, and then open a terminal/cmd in this directory and run `node colettebot.js`.

### Setting up credentials

Create `auth.json` to use your Discord email and password, and then run `node hydrabot.js`.

What `auth.json` should look like:
```js
{
    "email" : "your email",
    "password" : "your password"
}
```
